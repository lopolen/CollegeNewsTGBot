It will be a college news bot for Telegram, as u can understand. It will have a bot itself,
a database to store users' data and lesson schedules, and an admin panel to make it easy
to upload news for our secretary. I also wonder about adding licensing to make sure that
I can simply cut off the script if my college administration doesn't thank me as well for this project :>)

Until I release the first stable release of the project, all rights to this project are reserved!
